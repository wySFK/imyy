    <h1 class="text-white" style="text-align: left;">My Dearest Charlyn,</h1>
    <p>
      You are the sun that lights up my day to become brighter,<br />
      You are the sun and i am the plant who really need<br />
      Your light just to be alive, <br />
      You are the whelve constellations on my stary little sky.<br /><br />
    
      
      You are one of the reasons why i live my life still,<br />
      Your  voice is one of my favorite music,<br />
      Your voice, a symphony of love and grace,<br />
      Your presence, a masterpiece in every space.<br /><br />
    
      your eyes is my glamorous mirror,<br />
      and you, all of you is my beloved.,<br />
      in every poems you are the metaphor,<br />
      in every moonlight you are the healing part.<br /><br />
    
      and in every galaxy,<br />
      you are my universe<br />
      and as deep as the pacific ocean,<br />
      I'm willing to swim and be drowned <br />
      if you're the one that i have to save <br />
      <h2 class="text-white" style="text-align: right;">With all my love,</br>Van</h2>
